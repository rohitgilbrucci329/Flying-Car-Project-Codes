# Flying-Car-Project-Codes
These are the codes that I wrote for the Flying Car Project that I did.

-The first part of the project was to solve a few questions from the problem statement pdf. The solutions of which I have uploaded. 

-The second part was to interpolate the values of weight of the battery and to estimate the total weight using Newton Rhapson Method.
