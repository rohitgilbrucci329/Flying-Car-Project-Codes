Explanation:

From the graphs shown, the blue line corresponds to 5Y-2X=0, looking at its slope and positive inclination 
made with the X axis, we can easily conclude that the line 5Y-2X=C where C corresponds to the value for max profit
will pass through (100,170). 
Hence, max profit in the case of X=100 and Y=170
